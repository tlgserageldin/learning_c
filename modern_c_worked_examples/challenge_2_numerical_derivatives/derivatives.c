/*
Something weâ€™ll deal with a lot is the concept of numerical algorithms.
To get your handsdirty,see if you can implement the numerical derivative double f(double x) of a function double F(double x).
Implement this with an example F for the function that you use for this exercise.
A good primary choice for F would be a function for which you know the derivative, such as sin, cos, or sqrt.
This allows you to check your results for correctness.
