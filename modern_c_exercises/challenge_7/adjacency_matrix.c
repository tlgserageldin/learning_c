/*
The adjacency matrix of a graph G is a matrix A that holds a value true or false in element A[i][j] if there is an arc from node i to node j.
    -- every row is a node on the tree
    -- every element of that row is the other nodes
At this point, can you use an adjacency matrix to conduct a breadth-first search in a graph G?
Can you find connected components?
Can you find a spanning tree?
